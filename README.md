Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains code and analysis for exploring a dataset of heart disease patients. The analysis was done in a Jupyter Notebook,
which includes various steps of data processing, univariate and bivariate analysis, and data visualization to better understand the underlying patterns in the dataset.\
Libraries like numpy •	pandas •	matplotlib 	•	seaborn are used .
We have used subplots, pairplot,stripplot,heatmap & scatterplot
Also KMeans , standardscaler,dendogram has been implemented in the project to get clear insights of the project
The data is futher divided into categorical data and numerical data .In Categorical data Null Values are replaced by mode and Numerical data is replaced by mean.
This is the overview of the EDA performed on this dataset
